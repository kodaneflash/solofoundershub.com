<callout-info>

This blog post is for folks who want to learn how to get started with Remix.

Note that Remix is as of yet still not officially released and open
source/publicly available. So if you don't have access yet, be patient. It'll be
launched soon!

</callout-info>

Check out [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com). We're going to build
a simple version of that in this beginner's guide. Here's what we're going to
cover:

1. Generate the project
2.

It's gonna be a good time. Ready to go? Let's go!

## Pre-requisites

If you want to follow along with this post that's cool. You'll just need to have
a recent version of [npm](https://npmjs.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
installed and available in your `PATH`. We'll be running some command line
commands. We'll also be writing some JavaScript (TypeScript) and React code, so
some experience with that would be helpful.

## Generate the project

Run this in your terminal wherever you keep your coding projects:

```sh
npx create-remix@latest
```

This will ask you a few questions about how you want to generate your project:

```
R E M I X

ðŸ’¿ Welcome to Remix! Let's get you set up with a new project.

? Where would you like to create your app? remix-jokes
? Where do you want to deploy? Choose Remix if you're unsure, it's easy to change deployment targets. Remix App Server
? TypeScript or JavaScript? TypeScript
? Do you want me to run `npm install`? Yes
ðŸ’¿ Created local .npmrc with Remix Registry
```

Sweet! You've generated a project! If you're curious to understand what the
different files and `package.json` scripts/packages are for, read
